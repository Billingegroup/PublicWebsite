Load powder into capillaries
----------------------------

Please watch the following two videos on how to load powder into capillaries.

`Loading samples I: Preparing capillaries <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgl-jkMqSsA>`_

`Loading samples II: Filling capillary <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JBTw4kEXGY>`_

Here, we have some notes for the video:

1. In the video, the eproxy is used to seal the capillaries. Sticky clay can be used to seal the capillaries as well.

#. A labeled flag can be attached to the top of the capillaries so that it will be easier to identify the sample.

Below, we list the technical standard for the sample loading at 28-ID-1 and 28-ID-2 beamlines:

1. We will be using capillaries only of size (OD) ~ 1 mm (~0.0402”), ~1.2mm (0.0435”), ~1.5mm (~0.0615”), or ~2mm (~0.075”).

#. The capillaries must have the proper length. Powder must be packed inside the capillary as per the drawing below.

#. Each sample in its capillary should be in one vial/Ziplock pouch/container along with the sample number label

#. Labels should be less than 5mm wide and attached as close as possible on the top side. Place tags at 2 different heights so that samples can be mounted in a consecutive order with alternating tag positions: high, low, high etc.(as shown in the picture) – otherwise labels of adjacent capillaries touch each other.

#. Sample capillaries will be inserted into the multiple sample holder (as show in the picture below). Each holder can hold max 45 including a calibrant on both side (43 + 2).

Sample shipment during the remote access
----------------------------------------

For collaborators:

1. Give the students in Billinge group the information about your sample and what kind of data you would like to get from it.

#. The student will reach out to you talk about the plan.

#. The student will give you the tubes for your samples if they are powder.

#. Load the samples into the tube following the instructions given by the student and seal them properly.

#. About one week before the beamtime, you will receive a document called "shipping label" from the student.

#. Print the label out, write down your home institution address on the shipping label, split the label into half and **attach the upper part outside your sample package**.

#. Mail the package to the address written on the shipping label.

#. When you mail the sample, if the client from the shipping company ask you to remove the shipping label outside, please insist keeping it. It is the important label for BNL stuffs to recognize your samples.

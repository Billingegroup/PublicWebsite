Beamtime responsible: Songsheng Tao & Connor Bracy

BG contact person: Your scientific project partner in the Billinge group

1. Read the information on this webpage to get an overview of what to do. There are instructions for the sample loading and shipping. Take note of any questions or concerns you have.
2. Meet with contact person in BG to discuss sample loading and shipment.

  a. What sample holders are needed (glass, Kapton etc), do you have them available?
  #. How do you plan on packaging them for shipping?
  #. Will the samples be difficult to prepare in any way? Stickiness, large grain size, only small amount of powder etc?
  #. Where will the samples be sent - to Columbia University or directly to BNL?

3. Fill in the sample information `Google Form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHb-ASZHIcwedvKZz-z-6hQ6BO7fgUq2dai07DOY-XDt5jrg/viewform?usp=sf_link>`_.

  a.Make sure each sample is listed with content, label and container type (glass/Kapton etc).
  #. Make sure to list the backgrounds. A background is a clean and empty sample holder  of the same type that you used for the samples. If you used more than one type, a background holder needs to be added for each.

4. Load the samples according to the agreement and the information you put in the Google Form.

  a. Follow instructions for getting powder into tubes in the video link below.
  #. For each sample holder type (glass, Kapton etc) include a clean and empty holder that can be used for background measurement.
  #. Label each sample according to the information in the Google Form such that it is clear what it contains (don't forget to label the backgrounds!). If you cannot fit a good enough description on the sample label itself, use numbers or letter on the label and then include a note that explains what each number/letter corresponds to. See instruction for labeling in the video link below.

5. Take a picture of the samples and their labels.
6. Package the samples. Use bubble wrap/cotton balls or similar for shock absorption.
7. Take a picture of the entire content.
8. Package the samples snuggly in an appropriate box or padded envelope.
9. Send your packages.

  a. If you will send the package to Columbia University, below is the address.

    | Columbia University
    | 1105 S.W. Mudd
    | 500 W 120th St
    | New York, NY 10027

  b. If you will send the package to BNL, please wait for the beamline responsible to send you **the samples shipping label**. Print out the shipping label and attach the upper part outside the package.

    | NSLS-II
    | 740 Brookhaven Avenue
    | Bldg. 740 – Loading Dock
    | Upton, NY 11973-5000

10. Send all three pictures to your BG contact person and beamtime responsible and wait for them to give thumbs up that everything looks alright.
11. Post your package!

Load powder into capillaries
----------------------------

Please watch the following two videos on how to load powder into capillaries.

`Loading samples I: Preparing capillaries <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgl-jkMqSsA>`_

`Loading samples II: Filling capillary <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JBTw4kEXGY>`_

Here, we have some notes for the video:

1. In the video, the eproxy is used to seal the capillaries. Sticky clay can be used to seal the capillaries as well.

#. A labeled flag can be attached to the top of the capillaries so that it will be easier to identify the sample.

Below, we list the technical standard for the sample loading at 28-ID-1 and 28-ID-2 beamlines:

1. We will be using capillaries only of size (OD) ~ 1 mm (~0.0402”), ~1.2mm (0.0435”), ~1.5mm (~0.0615”), or ~2mm (~0.075”).

#. The capillaries must have the proper length. Powder must be packed inside the capillary as per the drawing below.

#. Each sample in its capillary should be in one vial/Ziplock pouch/container along with the sample number label

#. Labels should be less than 5mm wide and attached as close as possible on the top side. Place tags at 2 different heights so that samples can be mounted in a consecutive order with alternating tag positions: high, low, high etc.(as shown in the picture) – otherwise labels of adjacent capillaries touch each other.

#. Sample capillaries will be inserted into the multiple sample holder (as show in the picture below). Each holder can hold max 45 including a calibrant on both side (43 + 2).

Beamtime Information
====================

Sample shipment during the remote access
----------------------------------------

For collaborators:

1. Give the students in Billinge group the information about your sample and what kind of data you would like to get from it.

#. The student will reach out to you talk about the plan.

#. The student will give you the tubes for your samples if they are powder.

#. Load the samples into the tube following the instructions given by the student and seal them properly.

#. About one week before the beamtime, you will receive a document called "shipping label" from the student.

#. Print the label out, write down your home institution address on the shipping label, split the label into half and **attach the upper part outside your sample package**.

#. Mail the package to the address written on the shipping label.

#. When you mail the sample, if the client from the shipping company ask you to remove the shipping label outside, please insist keeping it. It is the important label for BNL stuffs to recognize your samples.
